# Pipeline Configuration for Koopman Teacher Training

# Teacher Data Generation
teacher:
  num_samples: 100000          # Number of samples to generate from teacher model
  num_context: 1000          # Number of context points to randomly select from dataset
  batch_size: 1000          # Batch size for teacher data generation
  use_teacher: true          # Whether to use teacher model (set to false for direct training)

# Data Configuration
data:
  train_fraction: 0.8        # Fraction of teacher data to use for training
  save_teacher_data: true    # Whether to save generated teacher data
  load_existing_trajectories: false  # Whether to load existing saved trajectories
  teacher_data_dir: null     # Will be set to logs/{task_name}/teacher_data

# Training Configuration  
training:
  run_koopman_training: true # Whether to train Koopman model after data generation
  run_evaluation: true       # Whether to run evaluation after training
  compute_c2st: false         # Whether to compute C2ST scores (slow)
  evaluation_only: false      # Skip trajectory generation and training, only evaluate

# Model Paths (will be set automatically)
paths:
  flow_model_path: null      # Will be set to logs/{task_name}/flow_matching/models/best_model.pt
  koopman_model_dir: null    # Will be set to logs/{task_name}/koopman/models
  base_data_dir: null        # Will be set to logs/{task_name}/data
